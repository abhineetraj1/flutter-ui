1. **Create a Flutter project:**
   - Open your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your Flutter project.
   - Run the command `flutter create arrow_watch` to create a new Flutter project called "arrow_watch". Replace "arrow_watch" with your preferred project name.
   - Navigate to the project directory by running `cd arrow_watch`.

2. **Replace the *.dart file:**
   - Replace the default `lib/main.dart` file in your Flutter project with the updated Dart code provided.
   - You can either delete the existing `lib/main.dart` file and create a new one with the provided code or replace the contents of the existing file with the updated code.

3. **Run the Flutter app:**
   - Connect an Android or iOS device, or start an emulator/simulator.
   - In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory (`arrow_watch`).
   - Run the command `flutter run` to start the Flutter app on the connected device or emulator/simulator.
   - The app should now launch on the device or emulator/simulator, displaying the Arrow Watch screen with the timer and buttons.
