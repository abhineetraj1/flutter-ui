# Flutter projects
*	These are basic flutter projects, created for exercising dart with material UI.
*	Follow up [here]("/code")

## Installation

1. **Install Flutter SDK:**
   - Download the Flutter SDK from the official Flutter website: [https://flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev).
   - Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location on your machine.
   - Add the Flutter `bin` directory to your system's PATH variable.
   - Open a new terminal or command prompt window and run `flutter doctor` to verify the installation and check if any additional requirements need to be met.

2. **Set up an IDE:**
   - Install your preferred code editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA).
   - Install any recommended Flutter plugins or extensions for your chosen IDE.

3. **Create a Flutter project:**
   - Open your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your Flutter project.
   - Run the command `flutter create arrow_watch` to create a new Flutter project called "arrow_watch". Replace "arrow_watch" with your preferred project name.
   - Navigate to the project directory by running `cd arrow_watch`.

4. **Replace the *.dart file:**
   - Replace the default `lib/main.dart` file in your Flutter project with the updated Dart code provided.
   - You can either delete the existing `lib/main.dart` file and create a new one with the provided code or replace the contents of the existing file with the updated code.

5. **Run the Flutter app:**
   - Connect an Android or iOS device, or start an emulator/simulator.
   - In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory (`arrow_watch`).
   - Run the command `flutter run` to start the Flutter app on the connected device or emulator/simulator.
   - The app should now launch on the device or emulator/simulator, displaying the Arrow Watch screen with the timer and buttons.

## Building Executables

To create executables for your Flutter app, you can use the `flutter build` command provided by the Flutter SDK. Follow the instructions below to build executables for different platforms:

1. **Android APK:**
   - Connect an Android device to your computer or make sure an emulator is running.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory.
   - Run the command `flutter build apk` to build the Android APK file.
   - Once the build process completes, you'll find the generated APK file in the `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk` directory of your project.

2. **iOS App:**
   - Connect an iOS device to your computer or make sure a simulator is running.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory.
   - Run the command `flutter build ios` to build the iOS app.
   - Once the build process completes, you'll find the generated app file in the `build/ios/` directory of your project. This file has an `.app` extension.

3. **Web App:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory.
   - Run the command `flutter build web` to build the web app.
   - Once the build process completes, you'll find the generated files in the `build/web` directory of your project.
   - You can deploy the contents of this directory to a web server or host it on a static file hosting service.

4. **Windows Executable:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory.
   - Run the command `flutter build windows` to build the Windows executable.
   - Once the build process completes, you'll find the generated executable file in the `build/windows/runner/Release` directory of your project.

5. **macOS Executable:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory.
   - Run the command `flutter build macos` to build the macOS executable.
   - Once the build process completes, you'll find the generated executable file in the `build/macos/Build/Products/Release` directory of your project.

6. **Linux Executable:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory.
   - Run the command `flutter build linux` to build the Linux executable.
   - Once the build process completes, you'll find the generated executable file in the `build/linux/x64/release/bundle` directory of your project.

Please note that building executables for platforms other than your current development environment may require additional setup and dependencies. Refer to the Flutter documentation for platform-specific instructions and requirements.
